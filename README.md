## I have an idea for a block, can I ask for it to be added?
Sure, make an issue and I'll have a look at it.

## Why are the switches called levers?
switch is a programming keyword, so i would have to name them something along the lines of \_switch or switch\_ or zwitch or whatever monstrosity of a name you can think of
